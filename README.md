### WHY I WANT TO BE A UI/UX DESIGNER

I have often times come across digital products that give me a good feeling, and even though I might not actually need their product, 
I recommend them to friends, family and acquaintances.
Then again, I have come across plenty of products that I actually need to use, and while they perform their functions optimally and 
don’t leave me wanting performance and efficiency wise, I find myself asking over and over again; why couldn’t they have done this or 
that, why did they have to do this, why do i have to do this, how on earth do i navigate this product, couldn’t they have put some 
thought towards the design and the ease of use of this product for the user, and last but definitely not the least, is there a 
better product out there that’s not just functional but easy to use and gives me better feelings than this?

These are all common things that occur every time a user comes across a product and often times, a functional product that has bad 
UI/UX Design ends up leaving the user with the bad feeling of being hassled. As the saying goes; “In the land of the blind, the 
one-eyed man is king” so even though a user would rather use something else, they are stuck with the product because it is the 
only one they have.

Personally, I would rather not create a product that would leave my users feeling like they are being blackmailed into using it because 
it is the only one in the market. There is no reason why a product can not be both functional and a delight to use. As a full-stack
developer, I’d like to ensure my users get the best experience from my product and the way to do that would be to not only focus on the 
functional aspect, but to also be able to empathize and create something any user would be able to use, across race, gender, age 
and literacy levels.
